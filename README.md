## Yeti Pass
Team 4 Members: Elijah Payton, Coâ€™Niya Butler, John Virga, Stephan Johnson, David Olivier, Emily Hollis

Theme: Epic Trial

Premise: A monk has to complete a rite of passage by reaching the top of a mountain stalked by a deadly yeti

Mechanics:
- Players create a grid-based path through snowfields that they yeti chases them down
- The yeti has AI that makes it chase the player when they are in view and then wander the carved paths until they find the player again
- Players have a score tracked by time spent and artifacts they pick up
- Players pick up boards and artifacts hidden under the snow
- Boards are used to build bridges to progress through areas
- Artifacts are used to boost score and some give short buffs that can boost player speed or slow the yeti
- Players get 4 lives and when they Yeti catches them, they lose one and are teleported back to the start of the level (progress intact)
